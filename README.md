## Nomic Games

This project aims to use Presage2 to create a multi-agent system with agents that can reason about changing rulesets. The game of Nomic, as defined by Peter Suber, is the basis for modelling such reasoning, but a completely unbounded implementation of Nomic is not the objective of this project.
